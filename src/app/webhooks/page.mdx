# Webhooks

In this guide, we will look at how to register and consume webhooks to integrate your app with NextStore. With webhooks, your app can know when something happens in NextStore, such as a new order being placed or an inventory update. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Registering webhooks

To register a new webhook, you need to have a URL in your app that NextStore can call. You can configure a new webhook from the NextStore dashboard under [API settings](#). Give your webhook a name, pick the [events](#event-types) you want to listen for, and add your URL.

Now, whenever something of interest happens in your app, a webhook is fired off by NextStore. In the next section, we'll look at how to consume webhooks.

## Consuming webhooks

When your app receives a webhook request from NextStore, check the `type` attribute to see what event caused it. The first part of the event type will tell you the payload type, e.g., an order, product, etc.

```json {{ title: 'Example webhook payload' }}
{
  "id": "a056V7R7NmNRjl70",
  "type": "order.created",
  "payload": {
    "id": "order_123456",
    "status": "pending",
    "items": [
      {
        "product_id": "prod_7890",
        "quantity": 2
      }
    ]
    // ...
  }
}
```

In the example above, a conversation was `updated`, and the payload type is a `conversation`.

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="#event-types" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>See all event types</>
  </Button>
</div>

## Security

To know for sure that a webhook was, in fact, sent by nextstore instead of a malicious actor, you can verify the request signature. Each webhook request contains a header named `x-nextstore-signature`, and you can verify this signature by using your secret webhook key. The signature is an HMAC hash of the request payload hashed using your secret key. Here is an example of how to verify the signature in your app:

<CodeGroup title="Verifying a request">

```js
const signature = req.headers['x-nextstore-signature']
const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex')

if (hash === signature) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}
```

```python
from flask import request
import hashlib
import hmac

signature = request.headers.get("x-nextstore-signature")
hash = hmac.new(bytes(secret, "ascii"), bytes(payload, "ascii"), hashlib.sha256)

if hash.hexdigest() == signature:
    # Request is verified
else:
    # Request could not be verified

```

```php
$signature = $request['headers']['x-nextstore-signature'];
$hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);

if (hash_equals($hash, $signature)) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}

```

</CodeGroup>

If your generated signature matches the `x-nextstore-signature` header, you can be sure that the request was truly coming from NextStore. It's essential to keep your secret webhook key safe â€” otherwise, you can no longer be sure that a given webhook was sent by nextstore. Don't commit your secret webhook key to GitHub!
